title: Datatypes and Flow Control Practice
---

## Instructor Prep

* Print out the activity below, 1 per student

## CFU from last night's HW/pre-work (10 mins)

 * PollEverywhere.com Survey - 3 minutes to set up, 7 to complete/discuss
   * Called `Data Types and Flow Control` - amy.elizabeth.holt@gmail.com / complete
 
## Introduce the Activity (2 mins)

  * 2 exercises
    * 10 mins to write code
    * 5 mins to share code
  * Then CFUs
  * If you finish the exercise early, finish the bonus. If you finish that, you can start on the next exercise
  * DO NOT SKIP CODE SHARE
  * It's okay if you don't finish. Finishing is not the goal.

## Activity (30 mins)

  * Instructors should walk the room
  * Identify students to share code on the screen
  * Try to spot common misconceptions

## Debrief (15 mins)

  * Have students share code on screen for each exercise
  * Popsicle stick for CFU questions (if time)

# Activity

## Exercise 1 (10 mins)

Open a Ruby file and create a variable called `pets` that holds an Array of three Strings representing the names of pets. Then, write Ruby code to print out the following:

```
The pets are <first pet name> and <second pet name> and <third pet name>
The first pet's name ends with a <last letter of first pet's name>.
The second pet's name is <length of pet name> letters long.
The third pet's name <does/does not> contain the letter s.
```

The output in the angle brackets `< >` should change depending on the values in your `pets` array.

**Bonus**: Update your code so that the first line of the output (printing out each pets name) works for any number of pets in the array.

## Code Share (5 mins)

With a partner, share the code you wrote for exercise 1.

## Exercise 2 (10 mins)

Write a program that will ask the user to enter some text

* If the text has an odd number of characters, print "ODD!"
* If the text has an even number of characters, print "EVEN!"
* The program should repeat this process until the user enters "q" or "quit"

**Bonus**: Create three versions of this program that use three different types of loops: `while`, `until`, and `loop do`

## Code Share (5 mins)

With a partner, share the code you wrote for exercise 2.

## Checks for Understanding (10 mins)

* What is a variable?
* What is a String/Array/Integer/Float?
* What is the difference between concatenation and interpolation?
* Describe three String methods.
* How do you retrieve an element from an Array?
* How do you add an element to an Array?
* What is a condition?
* How many `elsif`s can a conditional block have?
* How many `if`s can a conditional block have?
* How many `else`s can a conditional block have?
* What do `while`, `until`, and `loop do` do?

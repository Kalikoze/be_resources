# Class Methods

## Agenda


## Instructor Prep
- Have enough sticky notes so that each students has 2 to write on (could have on tables before class)
- Print worksheets from this gist: https://gist.github.com/ameseee/a000c62f3656a3e2f197bb9e565213c8
- On the BACK of that, print the "Digging In" Questions: https://gist.github.com/ameseee/d148fbda594876a33b4509d187fdef31
- Have slack message ready to send out code for the Hedgehog class

## Learning Goals
- Explain the difference between class and instance methods.
- Use a class method to create instances of that class.
- Distinguish between class and instance methods with the same name.

## Vocabulary
- Instance Method
- Class Method

## Explore
- With partner and no computer, work to complete the table on your worksheet. 
- THEN, hop on a computer and check your predictions. (Recommend you also slack out the code so students don't have to type out that whole class)

## Digging Into Class Methods
- Have students write answers to the digging in questions
- Have a class discussion to ensure everyone has come to the same/correct conclusion. 

## Demo/Practice
- Demo writing code for the User, then have students practice with the House.
- While/after completing that, students should answer the `Exploration` questions in the student facing resource.

## Post It CFU 
- Teach should create a 2x2 grid on board with markers. It might look like:

| CFU          | Instance Methods   | Class Methods  |
| -------------   |:-------------:     | -----:|
| Syntax          | _stickies go here_ | _stickies go here_ |
| Important Facts | _stickies go here_ | _stickies go here_ |


- Split the class into two groups and give each student 2 sticky notes (may be helpful to give each group their own color). Students will be given two questions to answer, each on a sticky note. They should do this independently. Both should be framed around the idea of: "Pretend a classmate missed this class and asked you to teach them about..."
- Group 1 should answer:
  * syntax for Instance Methods
  * Important facts about Instance Methods
- Group 2 should answer:
  * syntax for Class Methods
  * Important facts about Class Methods
- As each student completes their sticky notes, they should walk up to the board and place it in the appropriate spot.

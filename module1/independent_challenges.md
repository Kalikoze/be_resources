In week 6, students will participate in the Final Independent Assessment that will count towards the promotion decision. This is a 3 hour code challenge students will complete independently, meaning the student cannot seek help from other students, mentors, etc. Students are allowed to reference notes, other projects, and the internet.

In order to practice for the Final Independent Assessment in week 6, students will be given a weekly practice Independent Challenge starting in week 2. They will be submitted using a Github Pull Request, and instructors will give feedback in the form of comments on the Pull Request. These are not formal assessments, but an opportunity for the student to practice their problem solving skills and receive feedback from instructors.

## Administering Challenges

Independent Challenges are listed below by week, one of which is marked "public", meaning it is linked on the Backend Curriculum Site for students to practice. Instructors should choose one of the private challenges to give to the students. Typically, this should be different than what the students did the previous mod so that any repeaters are not doing the same challenges. For week 5, instructors can give the final from the previous mod as the week 5 challenge so that students see an example of what is expected of them on the final. For example, the rotation of the week 5/final could be:

* 1808
  * Week 5: Market
  * Final: Pantry
* 1810
  * Week 5: Pantry
  * Final: Museo
* 1811
  * Week 5: Museo
  * Final: Market

* 1901
  * Week 5: Market
  * Final: Pantry
* 1903
  * Week 5: Pantry
  * Final: Museo

This rotation means that any student who repeats will not be given the same final twice

The instructor needs to delete the turingschool-example repo (if there is one) and recreate it so that past pull requests are not visible. Then they need to copy the readme from the private turingschool repo to the public turingschool-example repo.

## Warmups

These challenges focus on a single problem or task and typically require one class and knowledge of Ruby Mechanics to complete. These challenges are not given to whole class, but can be used as practice.

* [Bad Connection](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/bad_connection)
* [Super Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/super_fizz_buzz)
* [Morse Translator](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/morse_translator)
* [Binary Translator](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/binary_translator)
* [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/caesar_cipher)
* [Scrabble](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/scrabble)

## Week 2

The week 2 challenge is an intro to Object Oriented Programming. It will require students to build two classes that interact, as well as use an enumerable.

* [Potluck](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/potluck)(Public)
* [Real Estate](https://github.com/turingschool/real_estate) - [1901](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/real_estate_1901)
* [OpenMic](https://github.com/turingschool/open_mic) - 1903

## Week 3

The week 3 challenge will require students to build three classes that interact. It will also involve a more complex enumeration problem that can't be solved with a single enumerable. Students will also need to access a Hash.

* [World Cup](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/world_cup)(Public)
* [Market Street Apartments](https://github.com/turingschool/market_st_apartments) - [1901](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/market_st_apartments_1901)
* [TV Network](https://github.com/turingschool/tv_network) - [1903](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/tv_network_1903)

## Week 4

The week 3 challenge will require students to build three classes that interact. Students must think algorithmically to build an Object Oriented solution that solves the problem. Students will also be required to build a hash.

* [Boat Rental](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/boat_rental)(Public)
* [Museum](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/museum) - [1903](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/museum_3)
* [Denver Public Library](https://github.com/turingschool/denver_public_library) - [1901](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/dpl_1901)

## Weeks 5 and 6

The week 5 and 6 challenges are a test of a student's knowledge of OOP and Ruby mechanics. They will involve two or three classes that interact, iterating over a hash, and several methods that can't be built with a single enumerable.

The week 5 challenge will be a practice for the final in week 6.

* [Reunion](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/reunion)(Public)
* [Market](https://github.com/turingschool/market) - [1901](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/market_1901)
* [Pantry](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pantry) - 1903
* [Museo](https://github.com/turingschool/museo)

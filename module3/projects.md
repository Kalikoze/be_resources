### Week 1 - RailsEngine

* Focus on using this project as a playground for students to practice their processes.

*Project kickoff*

* Give students a day-by-day breakdown of how to split their time.
* Be sure to have the students struggle on an BI problem prior to the ActiveRecord class. They don't need to solve the problem but struggling will prime them to get the most out of the session.

*TODO:*

* Add eval suggestions

### Weeks 2 and 3 - Brownfield of Dreams

* Create a project using [Conveyor Belt](http://conveyorbelt.herokuapp.com/)
  * Current [project board template](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams/projects/1)

*TODO:*

* Add eval suggestions


### Weeks 4 and 5 - Terrificus (self defined projects)

The first part of the week should focus on making sure students have a clear goal of what they are building. Wireframes, written stories, and meetings with an instructor usually give students the best chance at having a successful project.

Make sure they are thinking about demoing from day 1 which means they should probably handle the design early on. If it's an afterthought it usually shows.

The most successful projects tend to be 4 pages or less but executed very well.

*TODO:*

* Add eval suggestions

### Week 6 - Sweater Weather

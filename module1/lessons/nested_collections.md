## Learning Goals

* Use multiple types of collections intermingled
* Apply common hash and array methods
* Describe strategies for navigating nested collections

## Vocabulary
* Collection
* Data Structure
* Nested Array
* Nested Hash

## Slides

# Part One: Nested Collections Lecture (45 mins)

## WarmUp (15 mins)

* First, individually in notebooks or computer
* Then, share with a partner
* Popsicle sticks
* Reiterate: students need to be very comfortable with accessing, adding, and modifying array/hashes

## Hash and Array Nesting (30 - 40 mins)

* There's no new information here
* Still using same methods to access, add, and modify the collections
* Remember, computers are dumb. They will do *exactly* what you tell them to do.

#### Array within an Array (10 mins)

* 2 mins by yourself
* 2 mins share with partner
* 5 mins popsicle stick

#### Hashes within an Array (10 mins)

* 2 mins by yourself
* 2 mins share with partner
* 5 mins popsicle stick

#### Hash within a Hash (10 mins)

* 2 mins by yourself
* 2 mins share with partner
* 5 mins popsicle stick

#### Array within a Hash (10 mins)

* 2 mins by yourself

## Practice

* Divide students based on ruby-exercises/collections progress:

1. Finished all exercises
1. Finished "nested_collections"
1. Finished "arrays" and "hashes"
1. Working on "arrays" and "hashes"

* Find a partner in your group and work on the exercises.

## More Practice

* Allow groups that have finished working on exercises to do this extra activity

## Homework

* Complete the `data-types/collections` exercises in ruby-exercises

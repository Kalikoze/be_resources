## Overview

In the final independent project, students will build a program that can read plaintext messages from a file, encrypt/decrypt them, and write them to another file using a given encryption algorithm. Students are given an interaction pattern that describes an `Enigma` class that has `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods. Students should use Test Driven Development to create an Object Oriented solution to this problem.

## Learning Goals

* Use TDD as a design strategy
* Design an Object Oriented Solution to a problem
* Practice Algorithmic Thinking
* Demonstrate proper use of commits and Pull Requests
* Practice breaking a program into logical components
* Build classes that demonstrate single responsibilities

## Timeline

* Friday, week 5
  * Project Kickoff
* Wednesday, Week 6
  * Projects due

Students can also turn in projects early and receive feedback from instructors.

## Kickoff

During the kickoff, the instructor should discuss:

  * How the encryption algorithm works (students should review how it works before the kickoff)
  * Requirement to get a 3 in all rubric categories in order to be promoted
    * Number of classes required
    * Testing every method at both unit and integration level
    * Test coverage
  * Turning project in early to get feedback

## Check Ins

This project has no formal check ins. In place of a check in, students should turn in projects before the deadline to get feedback.

## Evaluation

Instructors will grade the projects asynchronously and send students their scores when they are done. Instructors should ask any student who receives less than a 3 in any rubric category to continue working on the project to earn a 3.

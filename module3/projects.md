### Week 1 - RailsEngine

* Focus on using this project as a playground for students to practice their processes.

*Project kickoff*

* Give students a day-by-day breakdown of how to split their time.
* Be sure to have the students struggle on an BI problem prior to the ActiveRecord class. They don't need to solve the problem but struggling will prime them to get the most out of the session.

### Week 2 - Brownfield of Dreams

* Create a project using [Conveyor Belt](http://conveyorbelt.herokuapp.com/)
  * Current [project board template](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams/projects/1)

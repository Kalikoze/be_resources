## Graduation Requirements

It's important to read this document with students during the module kickoff and on day 1; it's common that students struggle to meet requirements and sometimes end up not graduating or graduating on time.

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must successfully complete **each** of the following:

## Attendance - Be on time and present for 90%+ of scheduled classes, check-ins, and evals.

### Ongoing Work - Weekly Interview Questions

### Projects

See the [projects page](./projects/) for more information. All projects must be passing to graduate.

### Assessments

- [Mock Interview](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/tree/master/_backend/4module_challenges/assessments/technical_communication_assessment)
- We should do this as a mid-mod and as a final assessment

### Career Development

* Complete a 30-day post-grad [job search action plan](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md) (submitted in markdown for presentation _and_ via DM to your coach)
* Prepare a portfolio presentation to present to instructors, staff, and possibly a community member/alum during the final week of the module.
* Facilitate a gear-up session designed with other Mod 4 students.

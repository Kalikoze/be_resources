### Prior to Week 1

* Create calendar events for classes and send invites to instructors.
* Confirm outline on student facing BE site matches the calendar.
* Confirm classes on calendar have links to lesson plans.
* Generate groups of 3 for accountability and checks for understanding discussions Roster repo.
* Make sure the Mod 3 portfolio template is up to date.
* Determine who will be responsible for surveys and invite them to the survey channel.

### Week 1

The ultimate goal for this week is to get to know your students as individuals and get them to view their instructors as people. This will set the tone and help create an environment where it's safe to fail and leading to better learning, with less energy going toward less productive activities and worrying.

* Create templates for projects to be graded in Ruby Submissions
* Put together 1:1 schedule. Focus on non-technical topics such as:
  * What is their background? If it feels natural, see if you can gain insight into the culture they grew up with.
  * Why did they come to Turing?
  * What's been their experience so far?
  * What are their goals are by the end of mod?
  * Is there anything we can do to help them reach those goals?
  * Communicate that it's our role to help them reach their goals and we want to see them succeed.
* Put together schedule for project evaluations
* Put together pairs for week 2 project
  * We've seen the best results pairing students close in skill level. If trying to level up a student, see if there’s someone one level above them rather than one of the strongest in the class. The latter tends to lead to steamrolling and both students experience frustration.
* Friday - Send out weekly survey


### Week 2

* Create a project board and send to students (See week 2 project for details)
* Friday - Send weekly survey

### Week 3

* Tuesday - Review and send out mock assessment setup info.
  * Make sure the API is working the way you’d expect
  * Confirm students can sign up for an API key (you can have them sign up the night before if you’d like)
  * Send link to the mock assessment requirements and setup instructions
  * Update student-assessments repo for mock and final assessments
* Put together 1:1 schedule to discuss mock assessment results
  * Goal from these 1:1s is to let students know if their current trajectory has them passing the mod. If not, what do they need to do to close the gap. If yes, what should they being doing to improve and get the most value out of the remainder of the Mod?
* Put together form for gathering project preferences
* Friday - Send out weekly survey


### Week 4

* Schedule daily stand-ups

### Week 5

### Week 6

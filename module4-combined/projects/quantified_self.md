## Overview

Quantified Self is a two-week paired project where students will build an API and a front-end that will consume the API. They must be in separate repositories. This is a great opportunity for students to prove to themselves that they can learn and implement quickly. The app is a food/calorie tracker for a given day.

[Project Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified_self/quantified_self_full_stack)

## Learning Goals

* Create an Express API given specified endpoints and response formats.
* Create a front-end to consume the Express API built for QS.
* Be comfortable using JavaScript and confident that they can learn and implement a new language in a short period of time!

## Timeline

**Kickoff:** Week 2, Monday afternoon
**Due:** Week 3, Thursday 8am

## Kickoff

During the kickoff, the instructor should discuss:
* Goals of the project
* It's always harder than people think it will be. Do not push things to the last minute or assume that you'll have extra time at the end.
*

## Check Ins

There will be two official project check-ins, on Thursday of Week 2 and on Tuesday of Week 3.

Students usually prefer to pair and address the API first. Some will split off and work on both apps. Some with build out the FE with stubbed data first. Based on instructor guidance and what groups are doing, adjust your groups accordingly.

Students usually need 6 days on the API and 5 days on the front-end. There are always problems with CORS and deployment, so make sure to ask about that early and often.

As mentioned in kickoff notes, it's always harder than people think it will be. We have had some cohorts were no groups completed to spec; some where only 1-2 weren't quite there. Don't let them slip!!

## Evaluation

- This is an in-person eval; go through rubric in the way that fits you best.
- Make sure that pairs get equal amounts of time talking about their experience as well as code. Make sure there are no assumptions about which partner took on which part of the workload.

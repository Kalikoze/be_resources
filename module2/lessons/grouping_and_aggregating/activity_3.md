Now you'll solve a problem on your own using the concepts we've covered so far. The question is:

```
What is the length of each artist's longest song?
```

Use the same **songs** table from the previous exercises. Work the problem out on paper before writing the sql query. Once you have the sql query, check your answer with another group or instructor.

## Instructor Prep

- Print out CFU questions
- Flashcards - 10/student
- Skinny markers, highlighters

## On Your Desk

- 10 flashcards (tell students where to find them)
- markers/highlighters, whatever you want to use to make your flashcards
- Notebook, Pen


## Learning Goals

* Learn how to use & recreate the functionality of `.map`, `.select` and `.find` using `.each`
* Understand when to use `.map`, `.select` and `.find` appropriately.
* Learn how to explore new enumerables using Ruby docs.


## Vocabulary  

* enumerable  
* iterate  
* map, find, find_all
* return value


## Warm Up

* What is **iteration** and when do we use it?
* In your notebook, write the code to that you would use to print each of the letters in this array: `dynasty_1 = ["K", "e", "n", "n", "e", "d", "y"]`.  Write the code so that `dynasty_1` could be replaced with an array of any length.
* In your notebook, write the code that you would use to create a new array with capitalized versions of the following names.: `names = ['jack', 'bobby', 'teddy']`


## General Flow of Lesson

- Intro an enumerable, show some examples
- Students practice re-writing from an each to the best-use enumerable
- Students make flashcards
- Students turn and talk about their flashcards to solidify understanding

Repeat for each enumerable.


## Final CFU

Students will be given 5 minutes to answer the Final CFU questions on paper.
When time is up, direct students to switch CFU answers, and compare with each other. Give them 3 minutes to discuss. Then, take the last 2 minutes to make sure everyone walks away with the correct answers. They don't need to submit - the two rounds of feedback are just to reinforce.

* What do map, find, and find_all do? What do they return?
* What makes an enumerable preferable to each?
* What does the `?` on the end of a method indicate?

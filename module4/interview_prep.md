## Interview Prep

The famous struggle of Mod 4 is balancing the demands of the curriculum, which should be no less than that of Mods 1-3, and the job hunt. Over the course of 2018, several changes and additions to the curriculum have made to remedy this tension and better support students to enter the job hunt strong.

No matter how much we do, this will still be a challenge. The MOST important thing is that we set expectations for students and are extremely clear about how each experience in Mod 4 is supporting them in their job hunt.

Also, students need coaching on what tasks/activities are considered `job hunt` - (they commonly fall into the trap of thinking that if an application didn't get submitted in a session, they weren't productive at all). Job Hunt tasks include company research, coffee meetings (and set-up/follow-up), cover letter/resume tweaking, practicing code challenges, practicing answers to behavioral and technical questions (out loud is preferred!), listing questions to ask a company during interview, polishing projects on GitHub, and more.

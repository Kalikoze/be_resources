## Graduation Requirements

It's important to read this document with students during the module kickoff and on day 1; it's common that students struggle to meet requirements and sometimes end up not graduating or graduating on time. 

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must successfully complete **each** of the following:

## Attendance - Be on time and present for 90%+ of scheduled classes, check-ins, and evals.

### Projects

* Weeks 2-3: 
  - Pair - [Quantified Self](./projects/quantified_self/quantified_self_full_stack) or [Play](./projects/play/play)

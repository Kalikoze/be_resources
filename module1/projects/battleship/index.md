## Overview

In this paired project, students will build a command line implementation of the classic game Battleship. Students are given an interaction pattern for `Ship`, `Cell`, and `Board` classes. After completing these three classes and accompanying tests, students have to build an additional class and add to their existing classes in order to create a working game.

## Learning Goals

* Utilize Test Driven Development
* Practice Algorithmic Thinking
* Create an Object Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
* Work in a pair
* Use Pull Requests to collaborate with a partner

## Code Share Questions

* Available [here](/module1/projects/battleship/code_share.html)

## Timeline

* Monday, Week 2
  * Project Kickoff
* Thursday, Week 2
  * Check In
* Monday, Week 3
  * Peer Code Share
* Tuesday, Week 3
  * Optional Check Ins
* Thursday, Week 3
  * Project Evaluations

## Kickoff

During the kickoff, the instructor should discuss:

* Project setup
* The importance of TDD
* The requirement to build at least 1 additional class
* Students should be using a Pull Request workflow
* Don't leave your partner behind

## Check Ins

For the first Check In, students should have completed iteration 1 and ideally are working on the `Board#valide_placement?` method or beyond. The instructor should ask one student to walk them through the Ship and its tests, and the other student the Cell and its tests. The Cell is more difficult, so it is recommended that the instructor has any student they are concerned about walk them through the Cell. The student's ability to walk through one of the classes shouldn't be recorded, but instructors should discuss any students whose answers raised concern. After that, the instructor can provide suggestions for a path forward, point the students to helpful resources, and answer any questions.

The optional check in should be student driven, focusing on what the students need to do to complete the project.

### Notes for instructors:
- There are two sections. The first focuses on utilizing documentation for troubleshooting. The second on utilizing documentation for learning something new.
- For the first section, give students 5-7 minutes to reflect on these questions.
- As a group, discuss and share out answers to each question
- After each question, share some of the strategies listed in the lesson plans if they did not come up as a part of the discussion.
- Repeat the same process for the second section.
- If you are running out of time for the second section, focus on question number 2, then review the tips and tricks for learning new documentation listed in the lesson plan.

## Overview

The Take Home Challenge is a <1 week solo project at the end of Module 4. The purpose is to give students one final opportunity to build an app on their own - one last boost of confidence and excitement.

This project is new and only been given once - much room to improve. We saw some great outcomes - students were working harder, and were happier, during Week 6 than we have ever seen.

We currently have 9 project prompts that we distribute so only some students have an overlapping prompts.

Assigning Projects: Some are more structured and some are much more open-ended. Take into consideration what will be best for each student rather than randomly assigning.

## Timeline

## Kickoff

During the kickoff, the instructor should discuss:
* The expectation is that you conduct yourself like an candidate for a job in all interactions with instructors during this project.
* The evaluation will be conducted as if you are bringing your code back to the company you are interviewing with.
* You should have fun with this - find a way to highlight your strengths as a developer and show your personality with this!

## Check Ins

A formal check-in is not on the calendar for this project, but instructors should be available to meet for one.

## Evaluation

As mentioned earlier, instructors should hold evaluations as if they are part of an interview. Students are expected to arrive prepared to present their code and decisions and answer questions about it.

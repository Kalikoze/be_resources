## Overview

Students build a program that simulates studying with flashcards. They are given an interaction pattern that describes 4 classes: `Card`, `Turn`, `Deck`, and `Round`, as well as a test file for the `Card` class. After creating these four classes and accompanying tests, students put them together to create the functioning program.

## Learning Goals

* Follow an interaction pattern
* Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
* Write tests
* Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
* Host code on Github and submit a Pull Request

## Timeline

* Monday, Week 1
  * Project Kickoff
* Thursday, Week 1
  * Project Checkins
* Monday, Week 2
  * Project due at 9am
  * Peer Code Review
* Later in Week 2
  * Instructors grade projects

## Kickoff

During the kickoff, the Instructor should discuss:

* How to setup the project (Fork and Clone)
* How to read an interaction pattern
* How you can use Pry to check your work against the interaction pattern
* How this relates to the given tests
* How to run the tests
* Emphasize the importance of testing, and that students should not wait until the testing lesson to start writing tests

## Check In

Students should be at least through Iteration 1 (creating a Card class, Turn class, and Turn test). Ideally, the student has also created a Deck and DeckTest and is working on the Round.

This Check In should focus on testing. The student should have been able to write tests based on the examples of testing theyâ€™ve seen in the given CardTest and the Ruby Exercises. This checkin is usually on the same day as the How Testing Works lesson, so they might not have attempted or been able to write the tests yet. If a student does not have their own tests written, the instructor should help them write tests for the Turn class. If a student does have their own tests written, the instructor should review their tests and help them fix issues.

## Peer Code Review

[Instructions for the Peer Code Review can be found here.](/module1/lessons/flashcards_peer_code_review.html)

## Evaluation

Instructors will grade projects independently. Students will submit a Pull Request to the [turingschool-examples Repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/flash_cards). Every project will receive scores in the [Ruby Submissions Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions) as well as comments on the Pull Request.

### Prior to Week 1

* Create calendar events for classes and send invites to instructors.
* Confirm outline on student facing BE site matches the calendar.
* Confirm classes on calendar have links to lesson plans..
* Make sure the Mod 3 portfolio template is up to date.

### Week 1

The ultimate goal for this week is to get to know your students as individuals and get them to view their instructors as people. This will set the tone and help create an environment where it's safe to fail and leading to better learning, with less energy going toward less productive activities and worrying.

* Put together pairs for project
  * We've seen the best results pairing students close in skill level. If trying to level up a student, see if thereâ€™s someone one level above them rather than one of the strongest in the class. The latter tends to lead to steamrolling and both students experience frustration.
* In the Mod 3 intro create time for introductions
  * Name
  * Pronouns
  * What brought you to Turing/What did you do before Turing?
* Put together schedule for project evaluations

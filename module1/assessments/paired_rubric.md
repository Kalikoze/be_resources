## Functionality: 3

  * **4** Student starts developing and can describe the completion of a viable solution for iteration 4
  * **3** Student completes iteration 3
  * **2** Student completes the first 3 tasks
  * **1** Student completes the first 2 tasks

## Object Oriented Programming

  * **4** - Student is able to complete iteration 3 with no prompting.
  * **3** - Student is able to complete all tasks in iteration 3, but may need to be prompted for the third and fourth tasks.
  * **2** - Student is able to complete the first two tasks, but may need prompting for the second.
  * **1** - Student is not able to complete the first task without prompting.

## TDD

  * **4** - Student always builds and runs accurate tests prior to implementing functionality.
  * **3** - Student builds and runs tests prior to implementing functionality that accurately describe the behavior required in iteration 3. Instructor may prompt students a few times to run/write tests first or spot small issues in tests.
  * **2** - Student can build and run tests prior to implementing functionality when instructor gives a description of what the test should test for.
  * **1** - Student is only able to build tests when instructor gives specific instructions on how to write the tests.

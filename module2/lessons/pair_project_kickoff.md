title: Pair Project Kickoff
layout: page
---

## Prep

- Use [roster](https://github.com/turingschool/roster) to pair students together
- Share partnerships in cohort's public channel

## Introduction

Your pair project is a Rails app that you will create from scratch.

Drop this URL in the cohort's public channel
https://github.com/turingschool-projects/bookclub

- Clone down a previous cohort's project, run it to demo to students in kickoff

Review the user stories
https://github.com/turingschool-projects/BookClub/blob/master/User_Stories.md

## Demo

## Eval

The project has a standardized rubric.

- Aim for "all 3's" before trying to get a "4" in any one category
  - A "4" will not balance out a "2" in something else

## Subject Matter

Since the user stories are well-defined, the subject matter should not be changed.

## Waffle.io Setup

We have the user stories for the project built in a way that we can "inject" a number of GitHub issues into a repo once a student sends along their repo URL, if the pair does not want to put the stories into Waffle.io themselves.

One student of the pair should create an empty repo and send that URL to instructors if they want to use the project user story injection.

## Approximate Workflow for First 2 Days

### Day 1:

- DTR with each other, put DTR markdown in the root of your project folder
- Sketch out some wireframes of an approximation of what they'd like their site layout to be
  - add Bootstrap or Flexbox etc to `/app/views/application.html.erb`

### Day 2:

- plan out database:
  - build model test validations
  - build your migrations
  - build your models
- prioritize user stories, feature tests

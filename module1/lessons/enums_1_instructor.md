## Instructor Prep

- Print out map/find/find_all [guided notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vwmgwLL_45v6HbEb2ktiWWNf42z4sIIzq0R9S0QvoY/edit?usp=sharing) 
- Assign pairs to students and send out pairs before class starts

## On Your Desk

- guided notes
- notebook, pen

## Learning Goals

* Learn how to use & recreate the functionality of `.map`, `.select` and `.find` using `.each`
* Understand when to use `.map`, `.select` and `.find` appropriately.
* Learn how to explore new enumerables using Ruby docs.


## Vocabulary  

* enumerable  
* iterate  
* map, find, find_all
* return value


## Warm Up

* What is **iteration** and when do we use it?
* In your notebook, write the code to that you would use to print each of the letters in this array: `dynasty_1 = ["K", "e", "n", "n", "e", "d", "y"]`.  
* In your notebook, write the code that you would use to create a new array with capitalized versions of the following names.: `names = ['jack', 'bobby', 'teddy']`


## General Flow of Lesson

- Intro an enumerable, show some examples
- Students given a task to perform using .each. In pairs, students work on computer to find solution to task. Whole group discusses possible answers and time is given to record answer on paper.
- Students then asked to do the same task as above, but this time using the new enumerable. Whole group discusses possible answers and time is given to record answer on paper.
- Students record syntax, return value, and best use cases for newly learned enumerable on the guided notes

Repeat above for all new enumerables


## Final CFU

Students will be given 5 minutes to answer the Final CFU questions on paper.
When time is up, direct students to switch CFU answers, and compare with each other. Give them 3 minutes to discuss. Then, take the last 2 minutes to make sure everyone walks away with the correct answers. They don't need to submit - the two rounds of feedback are just to reinforce.

* What do map, find, and find_all do? What do they return?
* What makes an enumerable preferable to each?
* What does the `?` on the end of a method indicate?  

## Extra Time

If students have extra time, they can work on the enumerable exercises that are in the ruby exercises repo

## Overview

Cross-Pollination is students' first formal opportunity to collaborate with FE students! In teams of 3-4, each containing members from both 'ends', students will self-select into groups/app ideas they are excited to be a part of, then work together for two weeks. We've seen a huge improvement in the quality of work (and life) since moving to working with the FE program.

[Project Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/cross_pollination/cross_pollination_spec)

## Learning Goals

This is a unique opportunity that presents some valuable goals:

- Ultimately, demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow (see whole-team expectations)
- Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

## Timeline

**Kickoff:** Week 4, Monday afternoon
**Due:** Week 5, Thursday 8am

## Brainstorm

This usually takes place on Thursday of Week 3.
During the brainstorm, students should come prepared to pitch ideas. We usually follow the format:
- 2 minutes per student
- What is the app? What problem does it solve?
- Tech stack you anticipate working with

Reinforce that while presenting an idea does give you dibs to work on that app if it's chosen by others, it's now a group project and you need to be flexible on it. If you aren't willing to be flexible on it, don't present it.

After this session, students should have an idea of what app they may want to work on, may want to chat with others over the weekend.

## Kickoff

During the kickoff, the instructor should discuss:
- Groups. Communicate with FE team to make sure there is a clear process for how groups will be finalized.
- Rubric, expectations.
- Reinforce the importance of DTRing
- Check-ins, demos, and evals are **whole-group**, no separate FE/BE. Of course, the FE devs won't know everything about the BE, visa versa, but it is ONE team.

## Check Ins

There will be two official project check-ins, on Thursday of Week 4 and on Monday of Week 5. Each group will meet with one FE and one BE instructor (same duo for the duration).

In first check in, feel out how it's going interpersonally and work-load-wise. Make sure they have a clearly defined MVP. Give them very honest feedback on where they are at in relation to goal and if they need to get work done. Check in on workflow, if it's bad, this gives them the opportunity to improve it before eval.

In second check in, check progress to MVP. Make sure they are still deployed, check in on workflow. Provide feedback on UI and things they want to consider for demos.

## Evaluation

Both instructors should meet with the groups for the eval:
- Walk through the application (FE and BE) and justifications of code
- Run the test suites
- Show the application is running on production
- Show application is using continuous integration
- Talk about lessons learned

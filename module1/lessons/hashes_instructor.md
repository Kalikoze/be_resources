## Vocabulary

* Hash

## Warm Up

What's problematic about using `fridge_items_1` as a grocery list? How would you prefer to structure a grocery list? Discuss with your partner.

```
fridge_items_1 = ["milk", "eggs", "eggs", "eggs", "eggs", "eggs", "eggs", "avocado", "avocado", "tortilla", "tortilla", "tortilla", "tortilla", "tortilla", "tortilla", "tortilla", "tortilla", "tortilla"]
```

## Exit Ticket

- In your own words, define a hash
- Venn Diagram of arrays and hashes
- Write a hash with 3 key/value pairs (assign to a new variable)
- Access the value of the first key/value pair
- Show how you would add a new key/value pair
- Delete any key/value pair of your choosing
- What is a symbol?
- For all of your examples, did you use symbols? If you did - re-write your original hash without symbols. If you didn't, re-write your original hash with symbols.

## Independent Assessments

In week 6, students will participate in the Final Independent Assessment that will count towards the promotion decision. This is a 3 hour code challenge students will complete independently, meaning the student cannot seek help from other students, mentors, etc. Students are allowed to reference notes, other projects, and the internet.

In order to practice for the Final Independent Assessment in week 6, students will be given a weekly practice Independent Challenge starting in week 2.

## Paired Assessment

In week 6, students will participate in the Final Paired Assessment that will count towards the promotion decision. Students will be required to complete a small coding task in advance of the assessment, and then will be given 30 minutes to pair with an instructor on an additional task that builds on their existing code.

In order to practice for the Final Paired Assessment in week 6, students will participate in the Mid Module Paired Assessment in week 4.

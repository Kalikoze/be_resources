## Mid-Mod Evaluation

In week 3, students will participate in a mid-module assessment ("mid-mod") that does NOT count towards promotion. It is simply a checkpoint progress indicator of which concepts each student has learned and is able to apply. Students are encouraged to focus mentoring and pairing sessions around topics where they did not perform adequately in the mid-mod.

Students are given a choice of a "theme" for the mid-mod. The implementation work is exactly the same.

* [core repo](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/tree/master/_backend/2module_challenges/mid_mod_assessment)
* [instructor notes for conducting a mid-mod assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/blob/master/_backend/2module_challenges/mid_mod_assessment/INSTRUCTOR_NOTES.md)
* [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/blob/master/_backend/2module_challenges/mid_mod_assessment/RUBRIC.md)

### Retake

There is no re-take for the mid-mod since it's an evaluation checkpoint only.


## Final Assessments

In week 6, students have a closed-book Final Coding Assessment ("FCA") and a Technical Communication Assessment ("TCA") that WILL count towards their promotion decision.

The coding assessment is mostly based on lessons in weeks 3 through 5. The TCA is almost entirely based on weekly written CFU questions covered over the entire inning.

### Final Coding Assessment ("FCA")

* [repo](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/tree/master/_backend/2module_challenges/finals/paired_final_assessment)
* [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/blob/master/_backend/2module_challenges/finals/paired_final_assessment/README.md)

It's important that the instructor conducting the FCA allows the student to struggle a little bit, but also provide some amount of help. If a student is weak in one area but performs adequately in other areas, the student could still pass. We don't want them to spin their wheels unnecessarily if a little nudge can get them un-stuck and continue successfully.

#### Grading

Students will be graded on the rubric, noting a score of 0, 1 or 2 for each of 6 categories:

- 0: the student could not demonstrate the skills; instructor had to help significantly with syntax and understanding to move forward with the assessment
- 1: the student was able to implement most of the work in this area by themselves, but instructor needed to provide some amount of help
- 2: student did all of the work without help from the instructor

Outcome:

- 11 points or better is a full pass with no concern (12 is a perfect score)
- 10 points is a "pass with concern" and feedback should be given to the student immediately for which areas they need to improve over intermission; feedback should also be entered into their portfolio feedback.
- 7 to 9 points is a "fail" and student is offered a retake. Let student know they need to block off a 2-hour period of time. (see below)
- 6 points or below indicates that the student needed significant amounts of help, and they should repeat the module. Students who repeat and score 6 points or less will be dismissed with no retake.


#### Retake

If a student is offered a retake, they are given a 2-hour block of time to complete one of the following sets of user stories on the primary code-along repo built throughout the mod. Instructors will choose which retake the student will finish.

This work is open-book, and passing grades are listed below.

- add "Awards" to the code-along repo
  - [user stories](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/blob/master/_backend/2module_challenges/finals/awards.md)
  - must finish at least 6 of 8 user stories to pass
- add "Genres" to the code-along repo
  - [user stories](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/blob/master/_backend/2module_challenges/finals/genres.md)
  - must finish at least 5 of 7 user stories to pass

### Technical Communication Assessment ("TCA")

* [repo](https://github.com/turingschool/assessment_challenges/blob/master/_backend/2module_challenges/1_final_verbal_questions.md)

#### Grading

At the instructor's discretion, answers are given a pass/fail for each of 14 questions. 11 of these questions come directly from written CFU questions that they have answered throughout the inning.

Instructors are encouraged to rephrase the question at most one time to ensure the student is clearly articulating the technical content requested. If a student can answer at a high-level but cannot describe things at a deep, technical level, the instructor may still pass the student on a question, but note that they need to practice technical terminology over their upcoming intermission.

Since 11 questions are directly from the CFU questions, a score of 10 out of 14 is considered a pass:

- 13 or better: full pass
- 10 to 12 points, pass w/concerns
- 8 or 9 points, student is offered a retake
- 7 or less: flag for repeat

#### Retake

If a student is unable to articulate their work well, a retake may be advised. Instruct the student that a one-hour period of time will be given to write out some additional work, also influenced by the CFUs. This work should also be closed-book, though this may be difficult to enforce.

- [retake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gvNWh_ak72s-mj5eUNmhGjVt0Gqsm908fHQKrtZms0/edit)

The current final written assessment needs some clean-up to be more clear what the expectation is for each question.

The instructor grading will provide a final grade of "pass", "pass with concern", or "fail" outcome on the entire document.


## Grading

The mid-mod and finals scores will be submitted by instructors to the private [Student Assessments repo](https://github.com/turingschool/student-assessments), beginning with the 1811 cohort.

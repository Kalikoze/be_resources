## Agenda


## Instructor Prep

- bring chart paper and markers
- Assign pairs to students and send out pairs before class starts


## Learning Goals

* learn about Inheritance a little deeper
* explain how Ruby objects inherit from other objects
* learn how to use debugging tools to see where behaviors come from


## Vocabulary  

* Inheritance
* Superclass
* Module
* Object Model
* Look Up Chain


## Warm-Up

* What's the difference between a class and an instance from Ruby's perspective?
* How are modules used as "mix-ins"?
* How do you know what variables, methods and classes you have available at any given time?


## Investigation methods as tools

* `.ancestors`: lists all classes along the inheritance chain, and any modules included by those classes
* `.included_modules`: returns a list of all modules included by any class along the inheritance chain
* `.superclass`: returns the superclass (parent class) of the class

# Class Methods

## Agenda

## Instructor Prep
- Have enough sticky notes so that each students has 2 to write on (could have on tables before class)

## Learning Goals
- Explain the difference between class and instance methods.
- Use a class method to create instances of that class.
- Distinguish between class and instance methods with the same name.

## Vocabulary
- Instance Method
- Class Method


## Post It CFU 
- Teach should create a 2x2 grid on board with markers. It might look like:

| CFU          | Instance Methods   | Class Methods  |
| -------------   |:-------------:     | -----:|
| Syntax          | _stickies go here_ | _stickies go here_ |
| Important Facts | _stickies go here_ | _stickies go here_ |


- Split the class into two groups and give each student 2 sticky notes (may be helpful to give each group their own color). Students will be given two questions to answer, each on a sticky note. They should do this independently. Both should be framed around the idea of: "Pretend a classmate missed this class and asked you to teach them about..."
- Group 1 should answer:
  * syntax for Instance Methods
  * Important facts about Instance Methods
- Group 2 should answer:
  * syntax for Class Methods
  * Important facts about Class Methods
- As each student completes their sticky notes, they should walk up to the board and place it in the appropriate spot.

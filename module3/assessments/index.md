## Assessment Reminders

### Setup

* Confirm API is working
* Confirm new accounts can sign up
* Review user stories and spec
* Create submission form. Include name, link to repo, and required environment variables.

## Grading

* Any non-passing assessments should be reviewed by more than one instructor to guard against bias

### Criteria

    * POROs
    * Implements a design pattern: facade, etc.
    * Uses POROs instead of hash literals
* Has a functional Request Spec

* **passing**: Demonstrates all of the above
* **pass with concerns**: Is functional, and demonstrates one other criteria
* **fail**: Is not functional, or has neither testing nor abstraction/encapsulation

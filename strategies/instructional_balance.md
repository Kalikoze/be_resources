# Opening Reflection (5 min)

* Think back to your most recent lesson that you taught...what % of time were you talking during the lesson?

* Read this article: https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/teacher-talking-time

If we consider these strategies on a spectrum, how can we make the learning loops smaller? Right now we have a long loop between instruction and projects. We can create smaller loops within a lessonâ€¦

* Teacher focused mini lesson 20 minutes -- student centered exploration for 40
* Student exploration to kick off a lesson 30 minutes -- teacher centered lecture to correct/confirm key take aways

We can create smaller loops within a day

* Homework assignment for student exploration -- review homework with teacher centered explanation and corrections
* Teacher centered walk through of a process -- student centered homework to apply the skill

## Discussion:
What are the barriers to student centered learning?
What are the benefits to student centered learning?

## How can we improve our pedagogy? (10 min)

Read [this](https://edpolicy.stanford.edu/node/1208) article and reflect on questions 1-8.

Specifically consider these two questions in relation to your last lesson or your upcoming lesson:
  * Are students doing the heavy lifting in the classroom, or is class time predominantly teacher-directed?
  * What percentage of time do students have the opportunity to discuss, talk, interact with one another, and/or engage in dialogue? To what extent is this student talk a driver of learning?

## Apply It (15 min)

In your module teams, review your upcoming lesson and consider how you might be able to shift to more student centered lessons where students are doing more of the heavy lifting.

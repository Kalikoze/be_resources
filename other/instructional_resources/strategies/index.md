* [Lesson Plan Template](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/lesson_plan_template.markdown)
* [Teacher Talk Time](/other/instructional_resources/activities/teacher_talk_time.md)
* [Meaningful Co-teaching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zduqAhzTkHJVKxSE5zs5Ek66Kg_bd4tTpdq5OdzEaxA/edit?usp=sharing)
* [PollEverywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com) - Instructors need to create an account. From there, you can create questions and/or sets of questions that each student can answer from their computer. They can be multiple choice, then you can display the class results, they can be put into a word cloud, or just pop up in text bubbles as they appear. Great for whole class CFUs when you don't really need specific data on individuals but want to feel out where people are. 
* Across the Street Partners - to get students to engage with more than the same person through a long class, for certain questions, tell them to talk with the student at the table across from them. 
* Sticky Note CFU - have students bring sticky notes up to the board for 2-4 questions to see class trends. These can then be transferred to an anchor chart. 
* Stations - great for when students need to learn a set of things (several enums), or to practice a set of things. Even if they _could_ be doing the same thing from their seats, the act of moving around every few minutes will wake their brains up and help them remember the experience better. Pro Tips: number the locations and associated activites for smooth transitions, use a timer on the big screen, provide monitors/whiteboard/chart paper at stations if there is any instruction, tell students in advance which way they will rotate. 
* Use a timer any time you have activities longer than 1 minute. Longer Turn and Talks, partner work time, etc. in class. The timer helps students manage their time and should push them to work urgently.

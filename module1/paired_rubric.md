## Functionality

  * **4** Student starts developing and can describe the completion of a viable solution for iteration 4
  * **3** Student completes iteration 3
  * **2** Student completes the first 3 tasks
  * **1** Student completes the first 2 tasks

## Object Oriented Programming

  * **4** - Student's initial design for iteration 3 is ideal and needs no prompting from instructor.
  * **3** - Student designs an ideal solution for iteration 3, with minimal prompting from instructor. Student demonstrates comfort with object interactions.
  * **2** - Student is able to design a solution for iteration 3, but may need several attempts or significant prompting from an instructor; or student may have some struggle with object interaction.
  * **1** - Student is not able to design a solution to one of the tasks in iteration 3 without significant prompting from instructor; or student may struggle significantly with object interactions.

## TDD

  * **4** - Student always builds and runs accurate tests prior to implementing functionality with no prompting from instructor.
  * **3** - Student builds and runs tests prior to implementing functionality that accurately describe the behavior required in iteration 3. Instructor may prompt students a few times to run/write tests first or spot small issues in tests.
  * **2** - Student can build and run tests prior to implementing functionality when instructor gives a description of what the test should test for.
  * **1** - Student is only able to build tests when instructor gives specific instructions on how to write the tests.

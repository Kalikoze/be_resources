# Tasks to Complete for Next Inning (recurring work)

## Graduating Cohort:

- Move all google docs that were used for the past cohort to the archive, including surveys
- If you have any solid or excellent projects this past inning that would be helpful for other instructors who come to Mod4, please add them to [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-completed-sample-projects/tree/master/4module).
- If any student has not fulfilled all expectations for graduation and is being given a chance to do so, make sure the agreement on that expectation is documented and that Allison is aware of that situation. Be sure to follow up by whatever date is stated in that agreement.
- Send graduates the [Interview Question Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1IHLDJXAyg_xVb8hi00781IBIGoZ6XV41Lz4IWD8hZic/edit?usp=drive_web) and ask that they all complete it at least once; this allows us to keep our interview prep up to date.


## Incoming Cohort:

- Create tracking document of your choice
- Copy over or set up Google Calendar
- Set up Surveys in [this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0Bx6JZxtPBe_FaVBJNlFCdTFOOVE) - make sure questions align with topics taught in the respective week
- Review [Intermission Work](http://mod4.turing.io/lessons/intermission-work.html) and make any necessary changes by Wednesday of Week 6. Make sure you have a detailed plan for submission of intermission work and that it is communicated to avoid any confusion.
- Set up room appropriately based on incoming cohort size.
- Ask Mod 3 instructors for popsicle sticks; reach out to Ian if you need any more.
- If you don't do a formal hand-off, ask Mod 3 instructors for any students who shouldn't be paired together for any reason, anything else to be aware of socially, etc.

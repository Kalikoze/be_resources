- [Make It Work](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/make_it_work)

## Week 4
- [Vending Machine Tracker](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/vending-machine-tracker)
- [Order Up]()
  - Students should fork the above repo ahead of time, and then instructor sends out [these stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16f57X4YVGPNPrUds6Qn8yRNyhk1pdp7UYu2Pqt3rXyI/edit?usp=sharing) at the time of the assessments

Students will also have access to [Day Hike](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/day_hike) through the Backend Curriculum Site as additional practice.

Additional practice challenges: 
  * [The Final Rose](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/the_final_rose) - Longer than an actual in class challenge, but could be good preparation before Week 4 challenge, or prep for the final.

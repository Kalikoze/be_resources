## Stack Challenge -- Matching Brackets

https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/well_formed_strings.markdown

* Make sure you iterate from *simple* cases to more *complex* cases
* If you get done with the example cases, consider the "edge cases", for example:
  * What about an empty `""` input?
  * What about just a close `")"`?
  * What about too many closes `"())"`
  * Are any other characters allowed like `"( [ ] )"`?

Pay careful attention to the JavaScript/Ruby test cases.

If you finish early, work on the extension problem as well.

## Mid-Mod Evaluation
Students will participate in a mid-module assessment ("mid-mod") that does NOT count towards promotion. It is simply a checkpoint progress indicator of which concepts each student has learned and is able to apply. Students are encouraged to focus mentoring and pairing sessions around topics where they did not perform adequately in the mid-mod.

### Option 1
* Empty for students to setup early: [B2 Mid Mod](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/b2-mid-mod)
  - [Movie Tracker Stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/134eJDgubFdBqxsaBRicdBVypxRGF15pjqh1UctqoVXw/edit?usp=sharing)  for Instructors to send out at the time of Assessment

  
  
### Option 2
* Empty for students to setup early: [B2 Mid Mod](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/b2-mid-mod)
  - [Railer Coaster](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vCAdgkndzD5gLCoMBg91N1W3RQ4mfLAkSOCQHLmNa-s/edit?usp=sharing) for Instructors to send out at the time of the assessment

## Final Evaluation
All students will take a final assessment. Again, students will be given 3 hours to complete the assessment.

### Option 1
* [Field Trip](https://github.com/turingschool/field_trip) - This repo has the user stories in it. Do not send this out ahead of time.

### Option 2
* Repo to send out early: [Seattle Grace](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/seattle_grace)
  - [Seattle Grace Stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/145bAL6_VdodvXr0fJ-HM71FsCsFhUWjUNoJESO78RP8/edit?usp=sharing) for Instructors to send out at teh time of Assessment

## Final Evaluation Retake
If a student does not pass the original Assessment, they will be asked to do a retake. The retake will follow the theme of the evaluation they had done before, but with slightly different user stories. Again, students will be given 3 hours to complete the assessment.

### Option 1
* Field Trip Retake - students should delete their original assessment and refork the Field trip repo from above, but send out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/megstang/64ab9c82e76fac195f1f901a8372bb23) for new stories. 


### Option 2
* Seattle Grace Retake - In progress


## Rubric

| | Rails Syntax | MVC | ActiveRecord | Testing and Debugging |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 4 | Students effectively use Rails methods or strategies not discussed in class, and can effectively defend their decision to use those tools. | Student strictly adheres to MVC, and can defend decisions of where functionality lives. | Highly effective and efficient use of ActiveRecord beyond what we've taught in class | Prework tests are extremely well organized and nested. Student demonstrates excellent TDD during paired assessment. |
| 3 | Student effectively and independently uses appropriate Rails syntax to complete the user stories | Student adheres to the principles of MVC, with only one infraction. | Students appropriately choose class vs. instance methods. Students can CRUD resources using built in ActiveRecord methods and ActiveRecord associations. | Tests capture the behavior described in the user stories. Student demonstrates use of TDD, but may be prompted by the instructor once or twice. |
| 2 | Student uses appropriate Rails syntax with instructor prompting, or does not complete the paired user story | Student does not adhere to the principles of MVC, demonstrated by up to 3 infractions. Student is able to describe the principles of MVC. | Student needs  prompting from instructor in order to use ActiveRecord to CRUD resources, or student makes an incorrect, or inappropriate choice of using a class or instance method. | Tests do not capture the behavior described in the user stories, and/or the student does not demonstrate consistent use of TDD |
| 1 | Student fails to complete one or both of the prework user stories | Student has more than 3 infractions of MVC and/or can not describe the principle of MVC. | Student is unable to CRUD resources using ActiveRecord | Student is unable to write an effective test without significant instructor guidance. |

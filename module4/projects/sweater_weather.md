## Overview

Sweater Weather is a project that students started in Mod3, where they built a Rails API. It should have several endpoints for weather data as well as login/out, create account endpoints. In Mod4, students should solely be working on building out a front-end.

## Learning Goals

* Create an vanilla JS or jQuery front-end application that makes network requests to an API
* Form opinions and make/defend decisions about how to organize the code in a front-end application

## Timeline

**Kickoff:** Week 1, Monday afternoon
**Due:** Week 2, Monday 8am

## Kickoff

During the kickoff, the instructor should discuss:
* The expectation is that your API from Mod3 is complete and should not need to be touched (besides CORS). If that's not the case, meet with PM to make a plan
* The rubric, going through each point. Many categories are on this that they may have not seen before - especially the code review requirement in the communication section.
* Day 1 deliverables - and that you will be checking on them between 3:30-4pm.
* Thursday Check-In expectations (below, and in spec)
* This project doesn't impact graduation, but the learning goals of this are essential in order to be successful in the Paired Project in Weeks 2-3. Our most successful grads are the ones who really pushed themselves to take risks and learn some fun stuff during this week.

## Check Ins

There will be two official project check-ins, on Monday of Week 1 (day 1 deliverables) and on Thursday of Week 1.

What to look for (and make sure you communicate this to students beforehand):

Monday:
- repo & agile board created, PM given permissions
- project deployed
- cite 2 professional web apps for UI/UX inspiration
- color palette

Thursday:
- Basic structure of the page is set up with HTML and CSS
- At least 2 endpoints are being hit successfully
- Project is still successfully deployed

## Evaluation

Evaluations may run slightly differently based on instructor; we typically have them self evaluate on the rubric (which is recommended you print out), then have a discussion about it. Show app, agile board, GH repo. This project does NOT count toward graduation, but we want to provide helpful feedback.

## Instructor Prep

- Print out map/find/find_all [guided notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vwmgwLL_45v6HbEb2ktiWWNf42z4sIIzq0R9S0QvoY/edit?usp=sharing)  

## On Your Desk

- guided notes
- notebook, pen

## Learning Goals

* Learn how to use & recreate the functionality of `.map`, `.select` and `.find` using `.each`
* Understand when to use `.map`, `.select` and `.find` appropriately.
* Learn how to explore new enumerables using Ruby docs.


## Vocabulary  

* enumerable  
* iterate  
* map, find, find_all
* return value


## Warm Up

* What is **iteration** and when do we use it?
* In your notebook, write the code to that you would use to print each of the letters in this array: `dynasty_1 = ["K", "e", "n", "n", "e", "d", "y"]`.  
* In your notebook, write the code that you would use to create a new array with capitalized versions of the following names.: `names = ['jack', 'bobby', 'teddy']`


## General Flow of Lesson

- Intro an enumerable, show some examples
- Students practice re-writing from an each to the best-use enumerable that was just exampled
- Students record syntax, return value, and best use cases for newly learned enumerable

Repeat above for all new enumerables

- Students turn and talk about vocabulary to solidify concepts (vocab at bottom of guided notes)


## Final CFU

Students will be given 5 minutes to answer the Final CFU questions on paper.
When time is up, direct students to switch CFU answers, and compare with each other. Give them 3 minutes to discuss. Then, take the last 2 minutes to make sure everyone walks away with the correct answers. They don't need to submit - the two rounds of feedback are just to reinforce.

* What do map, find, and find_all do? What do they return?
* What makes an enumerable preferable to each?
* What does the `?` on the end of a method indicate?  

## Extra Time

If students have extra time, they can work on the enumerable exercises that are in the ruby exercises repo

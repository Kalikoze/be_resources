In week 6, students will participate in the Final Paired Assessment that will count towards the promotion decision. On Friday of week 3 and Monday of week 4, students will participate in the Mid Module Paired Assessment.

### Paired Assessment Repos

* [Pets and People](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pets_and_customers)(public)
* [Students and Courses](https://github.com/turingschool/students_and_courses)
* [Passengers and Vehicles](https://github.com/turingschool/passengers_and_vehicles)
* [Employees and Departments](https://github.com/turingschool/employees_and_departments)

Each of these repos contains a file `prework.md` that should be given to the students in advance of the assessment. For prework, students will be need to build two classes that interact based on a specific interaction pattern.

The repos also contain two other Markdown files with additional tasks for the assessment. Instructors should print one and give it to the students during the assessment. These tasks are open-ended coding challenges that strongly hint towards students building a single additional class that interacts with the classes they built for prework. If the assessment spans multiple days, it is recommended that the instructor uses a different task for each day.

Each of these repos also contains `lib` and `test` folders with examples of code that students are expected to build to pass the assessment.

The repo marked (public) is linked on the Backend Curriculum Site for students to practice.

### Schedule

Instructors should use the Final from the previous cohort as the Mid Mod. A sample rotation would be:

* 1810
  * Mid Mod: Students and Courses
  * Final: Passengers and Vehicles
* 1811
  * Mid Mod: Passengers and Vehicles
  * Final: Employees and Departments
* 1901
  * Mid Mod: Employees and Departments
  * Final: Students and Courses

This rotation ensures that a repeater will have a different final each time.

### Grading

Paired assessments will be graded on [this Rubric](/module1/paired_rubric)

The Mid Module and Final Paired Assessment scores will be submitted by instructors to the private [Student Assessments repo](https://github.com/turingschool/student-assessments).

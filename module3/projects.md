- RailsEngine

*Project kickoff*
* Walk through the learning goals
* Walk through technical requirements
  - Endpoints should be namespaced
  - Responses should be compliant with the JSON API spec.
  - Data imported from CSVs - create a rake task
* Walk through different endpoints (record, relationship, BI)
* Talk through the spec harness and how to setup it up i.e. same directory as rails engine project
* Give students a day-by-day breakdown of how to split their time.
* Be sure to have the students struggle on an BI problem prior to the Advanced ActiveRecord class. They don't need to solve the problem but struggling will prime them to get the most out of the session.
* [Evaluation Criteria](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine/evaluation)
* Opportunity for students to have a peer code share when not in eval outline can be found [here](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine/peer_code_review)



- Brownfield of Dreams

*Project kickoff*
* Walk through the learning goals
* Walk through technical requirements
* Go over the project board & talk about the labels
  * Review how students should be using the board
  * Explain Solo Spike
  * Explain Paired Commit
  * Review the prioritization of the cards
* Create a project using [Conveyor Belt](http://conveyorbelt.herokuapp.com/)
  * Current [project board template](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams/projects/1)
  * Make sure each pair has a project board

- Terrificus (self defined projects)

The first part of the week should focus on making sure students have a clear goal of what they are building. Wireframes, written stories, and meetings with an instructor usually give students the best chance at having a successful project.

Make sure they are thinking about demoing from day 1 which means they should probably handle the design early on. If it's an afterthought it usually shows. A good way to push them to focus on an MVP is to make them commit to demoing during the code fair.


### Week 6 - Sweater Weather

* Walk through the learning goals
* Walk through technical requirements
* This project should be a demonstration of the skills that they have learned over the module
* Students should present their project and be able to clearly explain their process and code implementation

### Final Paired Assessment

Students must pass the final in order to pass mod 1. Students that do not pass the final will be given a retake. In this final, students should demonstrate that they are able to write tests first that accurately describe the desired behavior. Students should then demonstrate comfort in using the classes they created in the prework and their knowledge of Ruby and OOP to accomplish the task given.

The Final Paired Assessment will be graded with [this rubric](/module1/paired_rubric). A student that scores a 1 (failing) in any category has failed the assessment. If a student scores a 2 (passing with concern) on one or two of the categories, the student has passed the final, although instructors may need to discuss exactly what the concerns are and possibly offer a retake. A student who scores a 2 on all categories most likely has enough concerns to warrant a retake.

### Final Independent Project

Students must pass the final project in order to be promoted, meaning they score a 3 (passing) in all rubric categories. Students will be given the option to turn in the project early and fix anything that scores less than a 3.

### Group and Paired Projects

Students must demonstrate success in either the group or paired project to be promoted.

### Professional Development

Students must complete all Professional Development deliverables.

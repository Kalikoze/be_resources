Week One launches the first student solo project in Mod 2.

This project is not evaluated (other than completion), and is a good time to have
fun building a light-hearted project.

As of Feb 2019, the project is [Laugh Tracks](/module2/projects/laugh_tracks)
to encourage some fun.

Since the project launches on Day 1 of the module, before students have learned
very much about web development yet, we need to guide their first few days of
development:

Day 1: Sketch out some wireframes of an approximation of what they'd like their
site layout to be.

Day 2: Now that ActiveRecord has been taught, plan the database; HTML/CSS has been
reviewed and grid/flexbox/bootstrap tools have been introduced, so turn the
wireframes into actual HTML and CSS.

Day 3: Start forming models and plan out some bottom-up testing

Day 4: Start writing feature tests and build out controller code to call model code.

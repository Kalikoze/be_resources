Students will complete two independent timed challenges throughout the mod:

## Week 2
- [Make It Work](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/make_it_work)
- [Hogwarts Again](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/hogwarts_again)
  - Students should fork the above repo ahead of time, and then the instructor sends out [these stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khty--ZC_3fWkJoseCobie-KniH5wajjlrhJON7UIH0/edit?usp=sharing) at the time of the assessment.

## Week 4
- [Order Up](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/order_up)
  - Students should fork the above repo ahead of time, and then instructor sends out [these stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16f57X4YVGPNPrUds6Qn8yRNyhk1pdp7UYu2Pqt3rXyI/edit?usp=sharing) at the time of the assessments

Students will also have access to [Day Hike](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/day_hike) through the Backend Curriculum Site as additional practice.

Additional practice challenges: 
  * [Vending Machine Tracker](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/vending-machine-tracker/tree/master)
  * [Apollo 14](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/apollo_14)
  * [The Final Rose](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/the_final_rose) - Longer than an actual in class challenge, but could be good preparation before Week 4 challenge, or prep for the final.
